  Nothing is here.

  Yet, here is the beginning,
  the beginning in affiliation with no space, and no time.

  The beginning is the difference,
  and, the beginning creates the difference.

```css
.jscode{
  color: #fd971c;
  font-size: 14px;
  text-shadow: 0 0 2px rgba(31, 240, 66, 0.75);
}
```

```printjs
  let terminalScreen = document.getElementById('terminal')
  let screen = document.getElementsByClassName("screen")[0]
  let terminal = ReactDOM.render((
    <Terminal/>
  ), document.getElementById("termdock"))
```

```mark
1
```

```printjs
  terminal.injectContent(terminalScreen)
```

```mark
2
```

  Yet there is no why,
  there is no how.
  The difference as it is,
  just as it appears to be, is different from the nothingness.

  The beginning is the origination of binary,
  the one is the void, the other is the difference,
  the derivation of the void.

  The why and how arises after the difference, and its combination,
  or perhaps, the differences beyond the binary.
