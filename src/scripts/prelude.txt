/*
  Nothing is there.
  Yet, everything is there.
  Void contains no difference,
  all is one,
  and one is all, is the void.
*/

/* There is no time, and no space. */

/*
  But there is the beginning,
  the beginning in affiliation with no space, and no time.
*/
```js
  console.log(this)
```
/*
  The beginning is the difference,
  and, the beginning creates the difference.
*/

/*
  Yet there is no why,
  there is no how.
  The difference as it is,
  just as it appears to be, is different from the void.
*/

/*
  The beginning is the origination of binary,
  the one is the void, the other is the difference,
  with respect of the void.
*/

/*
  The why and how arises after the difference, and its combination,
  or perhaps, the differences beyond the binary.
*/

/* Then the story begins. */
