Nothing is here.

Yet, here is the beginning.

```css
#terminal{
  font-family: 'VT323';
  color: #75715e;
  background: radial-gradient(#222922, #000500);
}
.overlay{
  background-image: linear-gradient(transparent 0%, rgba(10, 16, 10, 0.3) 50%);
  background-size: 1000px 2px;
}
.screen{
  padding: 24px 12px;
}
```

The beginning in affiliation with no space, and no time.

The why and how arises after the difference, and its combination,
or perhaps, the differences beyond the binary.

You probably don't know what I am talking about.
Neither do I, but let me show you something, pay attention.

```printjs
  let terminalScreen = document.getElementById('terminal')
  let screen = document.getElementsByClassName("screen")[0]
  let terminal = ReactDOM.render((
    <Terminal/>
  ), document.getElementById("termdock"))
```
```mark

```

Look, we have just made a terminal. You can drag or resize it.

It will show you some insight behind the magic.

```printjs
  terminal.injectContent(terminalScreen)
```
```mark

```
