Nothing is here.
Yet, everything is dynamically generated, like this, a cat.
```html
<img width='200px' height='200px' src='assets/cat_rainbow_halo.jpg'/>
```
The beginning in affiliation with no meaning, and no style.
Time to add some css.
```css
.htmlcode{
  color: white;
  font-size: 14px;
  text-shadow: 0 0 2px rgba(31, 240, 66, 0.75);
}
.csscode{
  font-family: 'Source Code Pro';
  letter-spacing: unset;
  font-size: 10px;
  color: #6f6;
}
#terminal{
  font-family: 'VT323';
  color: #75715e;
  background: radial-gradient(#222922, #000500);
}
.overlay{
  background-image: linear-gradient(transparent 0%, rgba(10, 16, 10, 0.3) 50%);
  background-size: 1000px 2px;
}
.screen{
  padding: 24px 12px;
}
```

The why and how arises after the difference, and its combination,
or perhaps, the differences beyond the binary.

You probably don't know what I am talking about.
Neither do I, but let me show you something, pay attention.

```printjs
  let terminalScreen = document.getElementById('terminal')
  let screen = document.getElementsByClassName("screen")[0]
  let terminal = ReactDOM.render((
    <Terminal/>
  ), document.getElementById("termdock"))
```
@initTerminal@

Look, we have just made a terminal. You can drag or resize it.

It will show you some insight behind the magic.

```printjs
  terminal.injectContent(terminalScreen)
```
@injectContent@
